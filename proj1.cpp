    *
    *       For example, using the notation <price, time> to represent an option:
    *
    *             <5.1, 10.0>  must be before <5.6, 9.0>    (price is less, so time ignored)

    *                                                         smaller time (3.9 in this case)).

    *       to be considered sorted.

    * Examples:

   /**
   * func: join_plus_max
   * preconditions:  both the calling object and the parameter are sorted-pareto lists (if not, nullptr is returned).
   * desc: imagine a different scenario (vs. join_plus_plus):  you are a parent with two children -- one living in city A and
   *         the other living in city C -- and they are both coming home for the holidays (let's call your home C).  
   *       You have a pareto-sorted option list for the A-to-C trip (this is the calling object) and a pareto-sorted option list
   *         for the B-to-C trip.
   *       Consider a particular option for the A-to-C trip <p1, t1> and a particular option for the B-to-C trip <p2,t2>.
   *         Clearly, the total price for selecting these two options is p1+p2.
   *         However (unlike in the plus_plus case), adding the t1 and t2 doesn't make sense right (the trips are in "parallel").
   *         What you care about as a parent is when BOTH of your children are home.  This is determine by MAX(t1,t2).
   *         Thus, the resulting "composite" option in this case would be <p1+p2, MAX(t1,t2)> (hence the name join_plus_max).
   *       
   *       Your job is to construct the sorted-pareto "composite" option list capturing the options for getting both children home.
   *         The resulting TravelOptions object is returned as a pointer (recall if the preconditions are not met, 
   *         nullptr is returned).
   *       
   * RUNTIME:  let N and M be the lengths of the respective lists given; your runtime must be linear in N+M (O(N+M)).
   *
   * status:  TODO
   *
   * TIPS:
   *      This one will take some thought!  If the specified runtime is possible, the resulting option list cannot be too
   *      large right (at most N+M in length)?  But there NxM possible pairing of options.  So enummerating all pairs
   *      of options cannot be an option (as was suggested for the _plus_plus case).  
   *
   *      Start by figuring out what the FIRST (cheapest) option in the resulting list MUST be.  
   *      Remember that a sorted-pareto list must be strictly increasing in price and strictly decreasing in time.
   *      Now think about what might be the 2nd option in the list you are building.  It must cost more than the first AND
   *         take less time.  To be more concrete, suppose your first option has total price of $100 and results in child A
   *         traveling for 12 hours and child B traveling for 8 hours.  Does it make sense to spend more money on child B
   *         so they can get home in say 7 hours?  Think about it!  The MAX function is important!

   * desc: This function takes a sorted-pareto option list and splits into two option lists:
   *
   *        - the options with price less than or equal to max_price (if any) are retained in the calling
   *            object (and only those are retained in the calling object).

   * RUNTIME:  linear in the length of the given list (O(n)).

   *        suppose your given list has 100 options and 40 of them are below the max_price threshold; 
   *        the other 60 options end up in the returnd list.  Still a grand total of 100 options and
