   *         take less time.  To be more concrete, suppose your first option has total price of $100 and results in child A
   *         traveling for 12 hours and child B traveling for 8 hours.  Does it make sense to spend more money on child B
   *         so they can get home in say 7 hours?  Think about it!  The MAX function is important!

   * desc: This function takes a sorted-pareto option list and splits into two option lists:
   *
   *        - the options with price less than or equal to max_price (if any) are retained in the calling
   *            object (and only those are retained in the calling object).
   *        - the other, more expensive options are used to populate a new TravelOptions object which
   *            is returned as a pointer (i.e., the expensive options are returned)..
   * 
   * returns: pointer to expensive options or nullptr if the calling object is not pareto-sorted.
   * RUNTIME:  linear in the length of the given list (O(n)).
   * ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENT:  for full credit you MAY NOT ALLOCATE ANY NEW NODES!  Think about it --
   *        suppose your given list has 100 options and 40 of them are below the max_price threshold; 
   *        the other 60 options end up in the returnd list.  Still a grand total of 100 options and 
   *        therefore 100 nodes.  So... there should be no reason to delete or allocate any nodes.
